## Contributing

Either request access to the repo and propose changes via branches, or fork and propose via PRs as usual. Please avoid pushing to the `master` branch whenever possible, so we can get a second set of eyes on any changes that go in.

## Thanks

Much of the early setup for this docker image was produced by [Guillem Franc√®s](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/entry/-/-/31934/adscripcion/guillem-franc%C3%A8s) and found in the UPF AI Group organization [[here](https://github.com/aig-upf/docker-images/blob/master/starter-kit/Dockerfile)].
